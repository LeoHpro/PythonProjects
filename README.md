Input: A text. For example "Green Tree"
Algorithm: The algorithm randomly shuffles the letters between the first and the last letter of every word from the input text. The outside letters always stay in their place. 
Output: Could for example be "Geren Tere"
The funny thing is, that the output of most texts you put into this algorithm will still be very well readable at the end.
